This is a Python Project where I have designed and implemented a control system for a quadruped robot using object-oriented programming principles. 

The system consists of two main components: a graphical user interface (GUI) running on a PC and a controller running on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 

The system should allow users to control the robot's servos, save and load robot states, and communicate between the PC and the Pico.
