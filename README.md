This is a Python Project where I have designed and implemented a control system for a quadruped robot using object-oriented programming principles. 

The system consists of two main components: a graphical user interface (GUI) running on a PC using Tkinter and a controller running on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 

The system should allow users to control the robot's servos, save and load statesof the Quadruped using JSON, and communicate between the PC and the Pico.

The Quadruped consists of a total of 8 Servos, 4 of them control the hip and the other 4 control the legs of the Quadruped.

Modules used for the Project:
